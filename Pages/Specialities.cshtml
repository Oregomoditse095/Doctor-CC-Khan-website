            <p>
                HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks the body’s immune system.
                If HIV is not treated, it can lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).
                There is currently no effective cure. Once people get HIV, they have it for life.
                But with proper medical care, HIV can be controlled. People with HIV who get effective
                HIV treatment can live long, healthy lives and protect their partners.

            <p>
                A child’s relationship with the pediatrician begins as soon as he or she is born.
                Parents are expected to already have one prior to their delivery. Otherwise, the
                in-house (hospital) pediatrician will be the first one to check on the newborn’s
                health until the parent finds a more preferred doctor.

                All procedures are undertaken with the best equipment, sterilisation practices and
                protocols. Dr Khan will take care in explaining the character of your
                procedure and any follow-on treatment required.
